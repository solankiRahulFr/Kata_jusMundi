A svelte app to convert the number to french word. ex. 22=>vingt-duex. (implementation till 1000000 before million)

## Live Example https://svelte.dev/repl/6a0797098f4d437da5eb5ce3f2ce3376?version=4.2.17

## Feature 

- Have used svelte framework.
- Have not used any LLM.
- The app component is **reusable**.
- The program is written as funtion which have **adaptablity**.
- The app is able to **comunicate** with the user, with UI of text input and simple button and showing the results.
- The functionalitu of the program is divided into small chunks of function according to the digits ensuring **maintainability**.


### Can roughly say that have used the facade pattern from structural design patterns as the internal details of the algo is hidden and interface is provided to communicate. And the strategy pattern from behavioural design patterns as the problem is broken into small chunks.
